            <p>While Viber has been on mobile devices for some time, you can now use Viber for 
                Windows to chat and text friends on the mobile app, as well as make video calls 
                on your computer. <br> <br>
                <b>Free calls from your PC</b> <br>
                Viber for Windows isn’t a standalone 
                app because it actually requires you to already have Viber installed on a mobile 
                device. After you install the client to your PC, Viber will automatically import 
                your contacts from your address book into the app. After you install the client, 
                there isn’t anything you need to configure and you can start calling and messaging 
                your friends on the mobile app. While Viber for Windows supports video calls, the 
                feature is still in beta. You can also send and receive text messages from 
                friends and start group conversations These messages are synced on both the 
                mobile device and PC. <br> <br>
                <b>Simple to use</b> <br>
                There isn’t a lot to see in Viber for Windows. It will show the contact list, 
                call log, and conversation history. The app does feature some options, like 
                real-time notifications, which is good if you’re in front of your computer for a 
                long time and don’t want to miss any messages. <br> <br>
                <b>Another VoIP option</b> <br>
                Using VoIP services, the quality of calls always depends on your data connection. 
                If you have a strong and steady connection, then there is nothing to worry about.
                Video chats require more bandwidth and considering the feature is still in beta, 
                you may not get the best experience using this feature. <br> <br>
                <b>A good extra option</b> <br>
                If you already use Viber, there’s little reason not to use Viber for Windows. 
                Considering many providers now limit data, using your home connection can save 
                you a lot of data. <br> <br>
                With free calling as the primary feature, Viber for Windows is a great app to 
                use with your friends.

            <p><b>Q: Is Viber really free?</b> <br>
                A: Yes. DownloadPin is supported by advertisers, so we can offer users software 
                free. By using our Download Manager to download and install software, you will 
                see advertisements for similar products you may also enjoy. There is no 
                obligation to download these additional software offers. <br>
                <b>Q: What Is DownloadPin?</b> <br>
                A: DownloadPin is a collection of some of the Web’s best free and free-to-try 
                software. DownloadPin features a mix of full program software as well as 
                software trials at no cost. <br>
                <b>Q: How do I download Viber?</b> <br>
                A: Just click the download icon located on the Viber page to download the 
                Download Manager. Once you have run the Download Manager, it will guide you 
                through the downloading and installation of the software you requested. <br>
                <b>Q: What is the Download Manager?</b> <br>
                A: The Download Manager is a program that facilitates the downloading and 
                installation of the software you desire. In using the Download Manager, you may 
                be shown ads or given the opportunity to download other programs that might be 
                of interest to you. You are under no obligation to download any of these items, 
                and can use the Download manager strictly to guide you through the downloading 
                of the software you desire. <br>
                <b>Q: I downloaded Viber but it doesn’t work! What do I do?</b> <br>
                A: Install or reinstall the program. First, re-launch the Download Manager by 
                double-clicking the icon in your download folder. Once you open the Download 
                Manager, follow the steps to download the program again, making sure to follow 
                each step on the screen. If the program still will not work, try re-downloading 
                the Download Manager. <br>
                <b>Q: My installation didn’t work. I can’t find the installation file. Where is it?</b> <br>
                A: If you cannot find the file, it may be because: 
                A corrupted installation file or a bad download. To fix this, simply download 
                the file and install again. A blocked installation or download. Check to be sure 
                hat your Windows settings are allowing your program to download or install. The 
                file is currently installing. Check in your system tray to see if the DownloadIQ 
                program is still running. If it is, just wait for it to finish installing your 
                download. The program may have already installed. Check your “Programs” bar under 
                the “Start” button and check if the program is there. If none of these solutions 
                work, simply run the Download Manager again so that you can download the file and 
                reinstall it. <br>
                <b>Q: How do I uninstall (remove) software from my computer?</b> <br>
                A: There are two ways to uninstall your program: Most programs can be uninstalled 
                using the Windows “Add/Remove Programs” utility that can be found in “Start 
                menu\Control Panel” or “Start menu\Settings\Control Panel”. Here you will see a 
                list of programs that are currently installed on your computer. Scroll down the 
                list until you see the title of the program you wish to remove. Select it and 
                choose to remove the program. If you cannot find your program in the list, you 
                will need to remove it via the “Programs” in your Start menu. Move through the 
                list until you see the title of the program you wish to remove. Select it and 
                look for an “Uninstall” utility. <br>
                <b>Q: What does “corrupt file” mean?</b> <br>
                A: A “corrupt file” means that the file you downloaded is broken and unlikely 
                to work. The file is not dangerous, it is just broken and you may have to 
                re-download it. There are a number of reasons this could happen, the most 
                common being an interruption to your Internet connection while the download was 
                in progress. In these cases we suggest that you retry your download. <br>
                <b>Q: What is “Shareware”?</b> <br>
                A: The software available for free download at DownloadPin is licensed in a 
                number of different ways. “Shareware” licensed programs (sometimes referred to 
                as “Free to Try,” “Free Trial” or “Try Before You Buy”) offer some type of 
                trial, this can be time or function limited. Once you’ve tried a shareware 
                program, you know whether it will meet your needs before you pay for it. If you 
                like a shareware program and want to continue using it after the end of a trial 
                period (typically 30 days), you have to purchase the full unrestricted version. 
                If on the other hand you do not wish to keep the software, you can just 
                uninstall it. <br>
                <b>Q: What is a “Demo”?</b> <br>
                A: “Demo” programs are usually meant to give you a small taste of a large 
                program. They usually contain only selected parts of the program while giving 
                you ample functionality, allowing you to decide if it will suit your needs. <br> 
                <b>Q: What is “Commercial Software”?</b> <br>
                A: Commercial software is software being developed by a business which aims to 
                make money from the use of the software. In most of cases it is a 
                demonstrational copy released by the manufacturer to entice customers to buy 
                their product. Commercial demos will usually only work for a short period of 
                time and/or have certain functions disabled. <br>
                <b>Q: What is “Freeware”?</b>
                A: “Freeware” programs are completely free to use and keep. They are either 
                distributed for the love of humanity, for fame, or as stripped down versions 
                of programs that do cost money. Always check the license agreement if you 
                consider using the application for anything than your personal use. <br>
                <b>Q: What are “Adware” and “Spyware”?</b> <br>
                A: “Adware” (advertising supported software) is a product that is available for 
                free and in exchange displays advertising banners within the software interface. 
                Instead of you having to pay for the software, the company creates revenue by 
                selling advertising space in the software product. “Spyware” is software that and 
                hides itself somewhere on your computer monitoring the behavior of your activity 
                on the web and passing this information on to advertisers. Spyware is often 
                installed onto your PC when you download and install other software published as 
                “Freeware” or as “Adware.” DownloadPin protects its programs from spyware and 
                adware in a number of ways. However, we strongly recommend that you read the 
                end-user license agreement very carefully before you install any program. Often 
                buried in the license agreement will be a disclaimer saying that information 
                about you and your browsing habits will be sent to third party advertising 
                company. <br>
                <b>Q: What is “Malware” or “Badware”?</b> <br>
                A: Malware (for “malicious software”) is software designed to infiltrate or 
                damage a computer system without the owner’s informed consent. It includes 
                computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, intrusive adware, and other 
                unwanted software. Malware should not be confused with defective software, 
                that is, software which has a legitimate purpose but contains harmful bugs. <br> 
                <b>Q: How can I get technical support for listed software products?</b>
                A: DownloadPin is a SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, we are UNABLE TO OFFER 
                TECHNICAL SUPPORT for listed products such as Viber. If you are looking for 
                customer service for listed products, please contact the authors directly. 
                The contact email address is usually included within the help documentation 
                and “About” dialog box that can be accessed via “Help” menu of the program 
                window. <br>
                <b>Q: Will the program work with my computer?</b> <br>
                A: To be sure that the software you are going to download will work with your 
                system you will need to check the Operating System Compatibility and the Minimal 
                System Requirements located below the description of the product. </p>
